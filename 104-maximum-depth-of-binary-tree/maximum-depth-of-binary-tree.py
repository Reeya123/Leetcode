            the reason why this is needed is because stack might append None nodes too
            The stack initially starts with (root, 1), which means it contains a valid node.
However, as the algorithm progresses, it pushes node.left and node.right into the stack.
If a node doesnâ€™t have a left or right child, it still pushes (None, depth + 1).
Later, when stack.pop() retrieves (None, depth), None does not have children, causing an error when accessing node.right or node.left.
